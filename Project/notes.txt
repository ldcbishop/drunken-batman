Need a separate User and Member table. Why?

To automatically fill in the MIMEType in the Document table, you
need to go into the Data BLOB column, and specify the column that
is meant to store the MIME type in the table

select wwv_flow.g_user from dual; (not sure what this is used for,
   other than to get user when documents are uploaded)

Devise a way to select a user that is selected when entering the application,
and that is the user that you use during the rest of the session in
the application.
